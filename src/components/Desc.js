                    We are looking forward to welcoming 
                    our second summer of ACE++. ACE++ 
                    stands for Access for Computing 
                    Equity and so much more! This is 
                    summer residential experience for 
                    current rising sophomore Tufts 
                    undergraduate interested in pursuing 
                    major in Computer Science (CS)

                    This program has been specifically designed for rising 
                    sophomores, ACE++ gives students the 
                    opportunity to take two of three foundational courses in 
                    Computer Science—specifically CS61* 
                    and an option of either CS11 or CS15—in order to learn the 
                    the structural knowledge and skils
                    needed to succeed as a Computer Science major in be free of
                    charge for accepted ACE++ Scholars. This program will also
                    cover the cost of room and board. Each scholar will be 
                    provided a stipend to further elevate any additional 
                    financial barriers that would arise from not working over 
                    the summer. The goal of providing this stipend is to allow
                    students to focus solely on gaining the skills they need
                    to move forward in their CS journey.

                    This year ACE++ will have a cohort of up to twelve scholars 
                    who will push and encourage each other through the summer 
                    (and beyond). Students will also have the unique opportunity
                    to connect with each other members of the computer science
                    community, participate in professional development 
                    opportunities, and engage with boarder Tufts community.
